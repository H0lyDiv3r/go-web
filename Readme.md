### Go web 
this is an implementation of a front-end framework using golang and WASM.


!notice
the start.sh is for me to start my dev env. it doesnt start the project.

if you want to see an example implementation. 
1, host the examples directory with http-server or a tool of your choice.
2, open your browser go to the location of the hosted directory and open wasm/index.html

if you want to see the code that is used to implement the to-do app in the examples. it is in the cmd/main.go file
